st.subheader('Introduction')
st.write('Dysarthria is a speech disorder that occurs when the muscles used for speaking are weakened or difficult to control. It can make speaking challenging, slower, or less clear than intended. People with dysarthria know exactly what they want to say, but the physical act of forming the words becomes a daily challenge.Living with dysarthria can be emotionally and socially challenging. Simple conversations that many take for granted – ordering coffee, chatting with friends, or speaking up in meetings – can become sources of anxiety and frustration. Some people may find themselves withdrawing from social situations or feeling isolated when others have trouble understanding them.')

st.write("It's important to understand that dysarthria doesn't affect a person's intelligence or understanding – their mind is as sharp as ever, but there's a disconnect between their thoughts and their ability to express them clearly through speech. This can be particularly frustrating in professional settings or when trying to express complex ideas or emotions.")
st.write("For those living with dysarthria, support from family, friends, and healthcare providers makes a significant difference. Speech therapy can help develop strategies to improve clarity, and understanding loved ones who take the time to listen patiently can help maintain confidence and social connections.")
st.write("If you know someone with dysarthria, remember to be patient, give them time to express themselves, and ask for clarification when needed rather than pretending to understand. Your patience and support can make a meaningful difference in their daily experiences.")
st.subheader('Treatment plans')
st.write('Treatment for dysarthria, regardless of the underlying cause, typically involves a comprehensive approach. Speech therapy plays a crucial role, helping patients develop compensatory strategies, strengthen affected muscles, improve breath control, and enhance articulation. In cases where traditional speech becomes impossible, therapists can help patients learn alternative communication methods. The key to effective treatment lies in early intervention and consistent practice, along with the coordination of various healthcare professionals working together to address both the underlying condition and its effects on speech.')
