# Multiple Sclerosis
st.header("Multiple Sclerosis (MS)")
st.write("""
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease that attacks the protective myelin sheath covering nerve fibers, leading to communication problems between the brain and body. When MS affects speech, patients often experience what's known as scanning speech, where words come out in broken syllables. The voice may also develop a tremor, and patients might struggle to control their breathing while speaking. What makes MS particularly challenging is its unpredictable nature â€“ speech difficulties can worsen during flares and improve during periods of remission.

# Parkinson's Disease
st.header("Parkinson's Disease")
st.write("""
Parkinson's Disease presents a different set of challenges. This progressive neurological disorder, caused by the death of dopamine-producing neurons, creates a distinctive speech pattern. Patients typically develop a soft, monotone voice (hypophonia) that can be difficult for others to hear. They often rush through phrases, only to pause unexpectedly, creating an irregular speech rhythm. The deterioration of speech in Parkinson's usually parallels the progression of other motor symptoms, making it an important marker of disease advancement.

# Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
st.header("Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)")
st.write("""
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) affects speech in particularly devastating ways. As motor neurons degenerate, patients initially experience subtle slurring that progressively worsens over time. The disease typically affects the tongue and lip muscles early on, making articulation increasingly difficult. Many ALS patients eventually lose their ability to speak entirely, necessitating the use of assistive communication devices. This progression can be especially challenging for patients and their families, as it impacts not just speech but also swallowing and breathing.

# Huntington's Disease
st.header("Huntington's Disease")
st.write("""
Huntington's Disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, creates a complex array of speech problems. Patients struggle with irregular breathing patterns during speech, have difficulty controlling their vocal volume, and often develop poor articulation. The disease can also cause involuntary vocalizations, adding another layer of complexity to communication. These symptoms typically appear alongside the characteristic chorea (involuntary movements) that marks the disease.

# Myasthenia Gravis
st.header("Myasthenia Gravis")
st.write("""
Myasthenia Gravis presents unique speech challenges because of its fluctuating nature. This autoimmune disorder affects the communication between nerves and muscles, leading to fatigue-related speech problems. Patients often notice their speech becoming more nasal and slurred as they tire, with improvement after rest. This variability throughout the day can make communication particularly frustrating, as speech ability may be good in the morning but deteriorate as the day progresses.

# Stroke
st.header("Stroke")
st.write("""
Stroke can cause various types of dysarthria depending on which area of the brain is affected. A stroke in the brainstem might cause flaccid dysarthria, while damage to upper motor neurons results in spastic dysarthria. Some stroke patients experience mixed dysarthria when multiple areas are affected. Unlike some progressive conditions, stroke-related speech problems may improve with therapy and time, though the extent of recovery depends on the severity and location of the brain damage.

# Brain Tumors
st.header("Brain Tumors")
st.write("""
Brain tumors impact speech based on their location and size. Tumors in the brainstem often affect basic speech control, while cerebellar tumors can disrupt speech coordination. Frontal lobe tumors might impact a person's ability to initiate speech. The encouraging aspect of tumor-related dysarthria is that speech may improve if the tumor can be successfully treated or removed.

# Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
st.header("Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)")
st.write("""
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) causes speech problems that vary widely depending on the location and severity of the injury. Patients might experience slurred speech, irregular rhythm, poor volume control, or improper pitch. The recovery process often involves intensive rehabilitation with a team of specialists, including speech therapists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. Many patients show improvement over time, though the recovery timeline can be unpredictable.
